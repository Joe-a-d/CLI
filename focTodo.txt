###MOTIVATION###
# todo.sh inspiration
# similar workflow, but minimal implementation.
Reduce cognitive workload when studying by taking notes in draft mode and collated them together at the end of session/day


############ TODO focus.sh ############

1. Config file

# SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
-- set on first run & save on cfg file

#### DEFAULTS
# Editor : vi
# Directory : unset CWD/TIL
# FileName :  default = <string>+date+counter
#### options : string,date,time,counter,projectName
# Format : md ; optional txt
#####

# SET FLAGS
#### override default
#### other options

### ESSENTIAL
# macOS priority | linux compatible preferable 

#[X] Write Template Header when opening File
#[ ] Read input logic
#[ ] Set deafult VARIABLES
#[ ] Flag logic

###WANTED
# script to :
    #collate by day
    #rearrange into thematic blocks given tag

# better process filtering so as to simplify timeUp logic
     # currently atom seems to use helper processes for tabs ; only the 1st open process is identifiable by FileName
        # multiple filters? startTime parsing?
